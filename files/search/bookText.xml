            1.6   Using Simple Present

            The simple present is commonly used in academic writing. It is used:

            1.  to write about general truths and facts that are   It takes about 12 hours for your body to digest a
              not limited to a specific time                 meal.

            2. to write about a repeated or habitual action  Every fall, Canadian geese fly south for the
                                                             winter.

            3.  to cite a source                             Sleep researchers say that most people dream
                                                             four to six times per night.


            4.  to give details about information from a book,   In “The Story of an Hour,” Mrs. Mallard learns of
               poem, or film                                 her husband’s death, but she does not feel sad.
               •  We use simple present because an event in a book
                or film remains the same every time we read or see
                it. This is called the literary present.

            Note
            Stative (non-action) verbs describe a state, rather than an action. They usually take the simple present form of the verb.
            Note the most common ones below.
            be (exist)    consist of     dislike     realize       seem           want
            belong to     depend on      include     recognize     understand






            1.7   Using Present Progressive

            The present progressive is not as commonly used in writing as other verb forms. However, it is used:

            1. to describe events in real time               In some countries, people are paying more
                                                             taxes than ever before.

            2. to write about the continuation of an event   Temperatures are continuing to rise because of
                                                             global warming.

               Combine these short sentences into one sentence. You can add new words and move words around, but
               you should not add or omit any ideas. More than one answer is possible, but these sentences require the
               simple present. (See Appendix 1, Building Greater Sentences, page 216, for tips on how to do this activity.)

                 1.  a. Florence is a city.
                   b. Florence is an Italian city.
                   c. Florence is famous.
                   d. It is the birthplace of the Renaissance.





                2.  a. The U.S. Constitution is a document.
                   b. It is fairly long.
                   c. It is easy to understand.






                3.  a. Music therapy is helpful.

                                           The Human Heart

                1  The human heart is an amazing organ.  It is responsible for pushing blood inside
                                                    2
            the circulatory system.  The left side of the heart pumps blood to the entire body.
                                 3
                                                                  5
            4  The right side pumps blood to the lungs to receive oxygen.  Our lungs do two things:
            they receive oxygen when we inhale and remove carbon dioxide when we exhale.

            6  Inside the lungs, the respiratory system interacts with the circulatory system.  Then
                                                                                  7
            the blood moves to the right side of the heart into a filling chamber, which is called the
            right atrium.  With each individual heartbeat, blood moves from the right atrium into
                        8
            a pumping chamber.  After that, the blood picks up oxygen.  Once the blood picks
                                                                  10
                               9
            up oxygen, it pushes back to the heart, filling another chamber, which is called the left
            atrium.  Doctors want to expand their research into the blood circulation of the heart
                   11
            in order to have a better understanding of both the heart and the blood that pumps
            through our veins.  The functions of the heart are truly amazing.
                             12



             1. In sentence 1, change an to probably the most.
             2. In sentence 2, change it to this organ.

             3. In sentence 2, change the word inside to throughout.

             4.  Combine sentences 3 and 4 using while. Make any other necessary changes.

             5.  In sentence 5, change our lungs to each lung.
             6.  In sentence 6, change the respiratory system to individuals’ respiratory
              systems.

             7.  In sentence 7, change moves to flows. We usually use this verb when referring to
              blood.

             8. In sentence 10, the phrasal verb picks up is repetitive. Change picks up to collects.

              add -ed (study – studied).
            2.  Irregular verbs in the past vary and do not end in -ed. Some common irregular verbs include go – went;
              have – had; and do – did.

                 2.5   Using Simple Past

                 The simple past is commonly used in writing to express an action completed in the past. It is used:

                 1.  in narratives to report historical or past events


                                                                  PasT         Now         FuTure
                                                                  The first televised presidential debate occurred in
                                                                  1960 between John F. Kennedy and richard Nixon.

                 2.  to explain how an event occurred             after an unusually heavy rainfall, the river
                                                                  overflowed its banks and flooded the town.

                 3.  in reports to describe methods or results of   seventy-five students completed a survey on
                   experiments                                    their use of technology for assignments.

                 4.  to introduce or cite another person’s academic   In her article, the author stated that current
                   research                                       research on the topic is inadequate.






                 2.6   Using Past Progressive

                 The past progressive is used less commonly in writing. It expresses an action in progress in the past.
                 It is used:

                 1.  to show an action in progress that was
                   interrupted by an action in the simple past      PIloT was laNDINg


                                                                      TIre blew ouT
                                                                  PasT         Now         FuTure
                                                                  one of the front tires blew out while the pilot
                                                                  was landing the plane.

                 2.  to provide background information in a       as President Kennedy stepped off the plane
                   narrative                                      in Dallas, people were cheering and clapping.

                 3.  to show an action in progress at a specific   at 10:30, the crowd was gathering outside the
                   time in the past                               town hall.

                 Notes
                  1.  Clauses in the past progressive often begin with as, while, or when.
                 2.  with a series of verbs in the past progressive, it is not necessary to repeat was or were.
                     audience members were taking notes, texting, and surfing the Internet.



                                                                                                  Common Uses  21

                                    The Beginning of World War I

                1  June 28, 1914, was a huge date in history.  Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-
                                                      2
            Hungary was visiting Sarajevo, which is in Bosnia-Herzogovina.  The Archduke was
                                                                      3
            riding through the city in an open car.  A teenager shot the Archduke.  He killed
                                               4
                                                                           5
            the Archduke, and he also killed the Archduke’s wife.  This event caused a series
                                                            6
            of actions that resulted in the start of World War I.  Austria-Hungary declared war
                                                         7
            on Serbia.  A week later, Germany, Russia, and France were involved.   Belgium,

                                                                          9
            Montenegro, and Great Britain were also involved.  This war lasted four years and

            12  Very few actually know how the war began.




             1. In sentence 1, the word huge sounds informal and conversational. Change huge to the
              more formal academic adjective important.

             2. In sentence 1, add the word extremely in the correct place and change history to
              the history of the world.

             3. Begin sentence 2 with the transition on that date and add the correct punctuation.
             4. The Archduke was with his wife. Add with his wife before in an open car in sentence 3.

             5. The teenager also shot the Archduke’s wife. Add and the Archduke’s wife to sentence 4.

             6. Combine sentences 3 and 4. Begin the new sentence with While and add the correct punctuation.

             7. Sentence 5 is wordy. Rewrite it so that it has only one subject and one verb.
             8. In sentence 6, add the adjective single before event and the adjective political before actions.

             9. There is no transition between sentences 6 and 7. Begin sentence 7 with the prepositional phrase on
              July 28 and add the correct punctuation.

             10. Combine sentences 8 and 9 into one sentence. Then combine sentences 11 and 12 into one sentence
              using the word although.

                                     1  According to scientists who study global warming, the temperature of the earth
                                  is rising, and it is humans who are causing this situation.  In the last century, the
                                                                                    2
                                  temperature of the planet has risen on average 1.53 degrees Fahrenheit.   For the past

                                  two decades, people debated this issue.   Some people still refuse to believe that global

                                  warming exists.  Others accept that it exists and that it is an urgent problem, but they

                                  do not agree on its causes or on the solutions.  The fact is that the planet has become
                                                                           6
                                  warmer, and understanding the causes of global warming will help us to solve this

                1  Last year, Murray College helped 5,000 students graduate.   The majority of them
                                                                     2

            programs.   Therefore, it is not surprising that Murray College is frequently ranked
                      4
            as one of the best colleges.   Why does Murray College have this high ranking?
                                     5
            6  First of all, students and their parents are very satisfied with Murray College’s high

            appreciate the small classes with professors who take a strong interest in student

            success.   Last year, graduates from Murray College said that the college was an
                    10
            excellent investment in their future.

              if needed.

             7.  The adjective high is repeated in sentences 5 and 6. In sentence 6, change high to
              excellent.
             8.  In sentence 8, change last year to today. Then change the verb to match the new
              adverb of time.

             9.  In sentence 9 add the adjective helpful to describe professors.

             10.  In sentence 10, change last year to since it opened over a decade ago. Change the

           Read the paragraph from a psychology project proposal. Then follow the directions in the 10 steps to edit
           the information and composition of this paragraph. Write your revised paragraph on a separate piece of
           paper. Be careful with capitalization and punctuation. Check your answers with the class.




              PROCESS PARAGRAPH


                                           Project Proposal
                1  For this psychology project, I will copy the change blindness experiment from

            chapter 7 in our textbook.   The change blindness experiment tests how well people
                                   2
            notice changes that happen.   For this experiment, I will stand behind the checkout
                                      3
            desk in the library and hand out a short library survey and a pencil to students when

            they check out books.   I will hand them the pencil.   I will accidentally drop the pencil.
                                                          5
                                4
            6  When I bend down to get the pencil, my partner, who is down behind the desk out of
            sight, will stand up and give the pencil to the student while I stay down and out of sight.

            7  We will record whether the student noticed the change and whether the student said
            anything.   The differences between us are going to be very obvious.   My partner does
                                                                         9
                     8
                                                    10
            not look like me, and I do not look like him.   He is 5 feet 10 inches and has dark brown
            hair and a mustache, but I am 5 feet 8 inches with light brown hair and no mustache.
                                    12
            11  We will both wear shirts.   We predict that many of the students may not realize that
            they have interacted with two different people.


             1. In sentence 1, change I to my research partner and I, since it is a joint project.

             2. In sentence 1, change copy to the more formal word recreate.

             3. The phrase the change blindness experiment is repeated in sentences 1 and 2. In sentence 2, replace
              it with this experiment because the word this helps connect ideas between sentences..

             4. Sentences 4 and 5 are sequential actions. Combine them. Begin with the word when and change the
              second pencil to it. Be careful with verbs.

             5. In sentence 7, add the introductory clause After the student leaves and a comma to the beginning of
              sentence.

             6. Sentence 9 is wordy. Rewrite it so that it has only one clause and the phrase each other. Then change
              look like to resemble.
             7. In sentence 10, replace but with while to emphasize the contrast.

                 ACTIVITY 10   Original Writing

               On a separate sheet of paper, write a paragraph (at least six sentences) about a future event or situation
               you think will occur. Use at least two examples of future forms and underline them; try to use three if
               possible.


               Here are some examples of how to begin.
                 •  There are several ways that technology may change education in the future.
                 •  Future air travel will differ greatly from air travel today in a number of ways.
                 •   In the future, people living in coastal areas will face multiple challenges as a result of rising sea levels.

            Notes
            1.  A preposition and its object is called a prepositional phrase. The object can be a noun or noun phrase.
            2.  Some prepositional phrases can occur in different parts of sentences. At the beginning of a sentence, a prepositional
              phrase is usually followed by a comma.

            5.2   Using Prepositions: Functions

            Prepositions and prepositional phrases are necessary in all types of writing. They are often used to
            clarify ideas or to express specific information. They are used:

            1. to show location                 above Germany / at school / by the sea / in Florida
                                                near an urban center / on the Internet

            2. to show time                     as soon as possible / at night / for three days / in May
                                                in the morning / since 2012
            3. to show direction or movement    along the coast / down the road / into the woods
                                                out of town / to the moon / up the hill

            4. to show a logical relationship   according to the boss / because of the problem
                                                in case of an accident / instead of the first idea
                                                rather than the original plan / without becoming a problem

            Note
            In academic writing, subjects are often followed by prepositional phrases. The verb agrees with the subject, not the
            object of the preposition.
               People in the back of a large room often have difficulty seeing a presenter’s slides.






           5.3   Using Prepositions: Combinations

            Prepositions commonly occur in combination with other words. They are used:

            1.  with certain nouns              One advantage of the first plan is its lower cost.
              noun + prep.                      The reason for replacing the two elements is explained in the
                                                following chapter.

            2. with certain verbs               In today’s economy, it is difficult for parents to provide for their
              verb + prep.                      families.
                                                Of the university entrance exams that students take today, only
                                                a few concentrate on testing critical thinking skills.

            3. with certain adjectives          A few engineers are concerned about the trend in some cities
              adj. + prep.                      toward extremely tall buildings.
                                                Many consumers are not interested in completing online
                                                surveys.

            in a variety of different ways.   Some people color their hair in order to hide the gray.

                                                   The Best Age for Children to Learn to Read

                                    Children should start learning to read when they are ready rather than at a specific age
                                   1
                                               2
                                  or grade level.  Typically, in U.S. schools, children start learning to read at six years old,
                                              3
                                  in first grade.  This works well for many children, but some children are not ready at
                                          4
                                  this age.  For those children, being forced to read before they are ready can actually be
                                          5
                                  harmful.  It can to cause children to lose confidence in their ability to read and in their
                                  ability to learn in general.  Experts agree that parents should expose babies and toddlers
                                                         6

                                  to books.  They also agree that parents should start reading to their children when they
                                  are still infants.  However, teachers should to encourage their students to read when

            6.3   Using Modals

            Modals are auxiliary (helping) verbs that change the meaning of other verbs. They can express ability,
            opinion, possibility, expectation, prohibition, or necessity. They can also express degrees of certainty.
            Modals are used in academic writing:

            1.  to express present or past ability or capability   Some animals can predict earthquakes up to
              (can, could, be able to)                       five days before one happens.
                                                             An Italian scientist said he was able to predict
                                                             the L’Aquila earthquake by measuring the
                                                             changes in radon gas.

            2.  to give an opinion or state a conclusion     In sum, 16-year-olds should be able to vote in
               (should, will, ought to, must)                national elections.
               •  This use is common in argumentative or opinion
                essays, especially in the thesis statement or
                conclusion.

            3.  to hedge, or to make information sound less   Some people believe that urban farming
              certain or direct                              could solve many of the world’s hunger
              (may, can, could, might, should)               problems.
               •   Academic writers use hedging to soften their ideas
                or to acknowledge uncertainty.
            4.  to express necessity or a requirement        The dust storms last year were so bad that
               (must, have to, ought to)                     everyone had to wear masks on their faces.
               •   Use must and have to for the present and future   The researchers must not reveal the results
                tenses. Use had to for the past tense.       of the experiment until they have analyzed all
               •   The negative modals must not and not have to have   the data.
                 different meanings. Must not refers to prohibition,
                 and not have to refers to lack of necessity.  Since they had enough data, the researchers
                                                             did not have to repeat the experiment.

            5.  to express a future plan                     This paper will compare daily life in Tokyo with
               (will)                                        daily life in Beijing.

            Notes
            1. See Unit 4, Writing about the Future, for more information on will.
            2.  In academic writing, modals generally appear several times in a paragraph. There is rarely only one modal in
              a paragraph.

            the relative pronoun who, which, that, or whom. An adjective clause follows the noun, noun phrase, or
            pronoun it describes.

            1. The relative pronoun can be a subject.

            a.  who or that for    Middle-aged people who exercise tend to have fewer severe health

               clause              1994 to 1999.

            2. The relative pronoun can be an object of a verb.

            a.  whom or that for   This is the man whom officials believe stole the information.
               people                            REL PRO   S       V

                 2.  An adjective clause with nonessential information (also called a nonrestrictive clause) is separated from the
                   independent clause with commas. You can delete the information from the sentence and still have the main idea.

                 3.  An adjective clause with essential information (also called a restrictive clause) cannot be deleted without losing
                   important meaning.

                 7.2   Using Adjective Clauses

                 Adjective clauses are commonly used in academic writing. They describe, define, identify, or give
                 additional details about nouns or pronouns. Use them:

                   information           building, is the tallest type of redwood tree.

                 Note
                 Use who, that, or which for essential information. Use which or who with nonessential information and separate the
                 adjective clause from the rest of the sentence with commas.



                  ACTIVITY 3

               Underline the adjective clauses. Write E on the line if the information is essential and NE if it is
               nonessential. There may be more than one adjective clause in a sentence.

                 RemembeR:  •  Use commas around adjective clauses with additional, non-essential details.
                              •   Do not use commas around essential information. To determine if the information is
                                essential, take it out of the sentence. Then check if the sentence still makes sense.



                  ACTIVITY 5     Common Error 7.2

               Read each paragraph. Underline the adjective clauses. Then add commas before and
               after the nonessential adjective clauses.

                 1.      The lima bean plant has developed a special protection against caterpillars that
                   eat the plant. When caterpillars start to eat the lima bean plant, the leaves release

                   a special scent. This scent which smells very good alerts other nearby plants of
                   the caterpillar danger. Then all the lima bean plants together release the same
                   strong scent. This scent attracts wasps which are a natural enemy of the caterpillars.
                    The wasps save the lima bean plants by killing the caterpillars.

                 2.      Alcatraz Island which consists mainly of rock is a very small island in the

                   middle of San Francisco Bay. It is just a little over one mile from the San Francisco
                   shore. At first, Alcatraz was a lighthouse, but for 30 years it was a federal prison
                   from which escape was almost impossible. To escape, prisoners needed to be very

                   good swimmers. This is because the water around Alcatraz Island which is very
                   cold and has very strong currents has Great White sharks in it. Now Alcatraz is a
                   popular park which people can reach by ferry.

                   the network administrators whom people call if they have computer problems.

              DEFINITION PARAGRAPH


                                            Shinichi Suzuki

                1  Shinichi Suzuki, a Japanese musician who lived from 1898 to 1998, wanted to
            find a way to teach kids how to play musical instruments.   He wanted that method to
                                                                2
            be easier, more natural, and more effective.   He saw how easily and naturally young
                                                   3
            children learned their first language.   He also wondered if children could learn to play
                                             4
            musical instruments in the same way.   This thinking led to the development of the
                                              5
            Suzuki Method.   Suzuki first called this method the Mother Tongue Method.   Suzuki
                                                                                 7
                           6
            thought that the earlier a child started to learn to play an instrument, the better.   The
                                                                                    8
            Suzuki method encourages parents to expose their children to music from birth.   It
                                                                                    9
            then has them start them in formal instruction at age three or four.   In the Suzuki
                                                                        10
            Method, formal instruction does not involve traditional methods.   Traditional methods
                                                                       11
            include studying music theory and learning to read music.   Students of the Suzuki
                                                                12
            Method first learn to play an instrument by experimenting on their own and through

            trial and error.   This is what they do when learning their first language.
                          13


             1. Combine sentences 1 and 2 by replacing He wanted that method to be with that
              was. This puts the main idea of the paragraph into the first sentence.

             2. In sentence 1 change kids to a more formal term.

             3.  In sentence 2, the essential adjective clause that was easier, more natural, and more
              effective does not state what is being compared. Add than traditional methods.
             4. In sentence 3, find a more academic and specific term for saw.

             5.  Combine sentences 3 and 4 with the conjunction and to connect the two ideas which
              led to Suzuki’s method. You do not need to say he twice so delete it from sentence 4.

             6. Combine sentences 5 and 6 by making sentence 6 into an adjective clause.
             7. Combine sentences 8 and 9. Replace It then has them with and then start them to
              make the first and second parts of the new sentence parallel.

                                  when people multitask, they are not actually focusing on more than one thing at once

                                  even though think that they are.  Instead, they are moving their attention between the

            8.1   Adverb Clauses

            An adverb clause is a kind of dependent clause. It has a subordinating conjunction, a subject, and
            a verb. It must be joined to an independent clause.

            Pattern                                          Example

            1. Adverb clause                                 Many people feel a lot hungrier
            subordinating conjunction + subject + verb       when they do not get enough sleep.
                                                               SC     S      V

            2. Adverb clauses within sentences
            a.  independent clause + adverb clause           a.  There have been fewer accidents on the road
                                                                since the speed limits were reduced.
            b.  adverb clause + comma + independent clause   b.   Since the speed limits were reduced,
                                                                there have been fewer accidents on the road.

            Notes
            1. When the adverb clause is first, a comma separates the clauses.
            2.  In writing, adverb clauses that begin with because or although usually go at the beginning of the sentence.
                 Although Orcas are called killer whales, they are not a threat to humans in the wild.
            3.  An adverb clause by itself is an incomplete sentence, or a fragment.
            4.  Common subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as soon as, because, before, even though, once, since,
              so that, though, until, when, whereas, whenever, and while. They are also called connectors.




             ACTIVITY 1


           Read each sentence. Underline the adverb clauses and label the subordinating conjunctions with SC in
           the sentences. Some of the sentences have more than one adverb clause.

             1. Although many children play on sports teams these days, parents should be aware that sports injuries
              in children can be serious and take a while to heal.

             2. The number of cigarette smokers did not decrease until the middle of the twentieth century when
              people started to become aware of tobacco’s health risks.
             3. Dermatologists believe that everyone should put sunscreen on their faces to protect their skin
              whenever they go outside.

             4. After cell phone cameras improved, digital camera sales dropped significantly.

             5. When people watch a solar eclipse, it is important for them to use special glasses to avoid eye
              injuries.

            8.2   Using Adverb Clauses

            Adverb clauses are commonly used in academic writing to express relationships between ideas in a
            sentence. They often indicate when, where, how, or why something happened. Adverb clauses are
            used to express:

            1.  a reason or cause (with because, since, or as)   Some people overeat because they are
                                                             depressed.

            2.  a contrast between ideas (with while,        While it is well-known that musical training
               although, though, even though, or whereas)    develops children’s motor skills, recent research
                                                             shows it also helps children mature emotionally.

            3.  a concession; an opposing idea that is       Although autism is considered a mental
               surprising (with although, though, even       disability, some autistic people are highly skilled
               though, or while)                             in art, music, or math.

            4.  a purpose (with so or so that)               Some people move to big cities so (that) they do
                                                             not have to waste time commuting to work.

            5.  a time relationship (with after, as soon as,   Sleep doctors say that it is better for people to go
               before, when, while, until, whenever, as, once,   to sleep as soon as they feel tired.
               or since)




             ACTIVITY 3


           Underline the adverb clause in each sentence. Then write the letter of the purpose of the adverb clause
           from the box below on the line.

                    2.   Though most meteorologists predicted heavy rainstorms, very little rain fell.

                    3.  The World Wildlife Fund is raising money so that it can help endangered species.

                    4.  Some people use turmeric for muscle pain since it can decrease inflammation.

              NARRATIVE PARAGRAPH


                                               Frogtown

                1  Near Los Angeles, there is a small town alongside the Los Angeles River that most
                                2
                                                                      3
            people call Frogtown.  Frogtown is not its official name, though.  There aren’t many
            frogs there now, but at one time there were thousands and thousands of very small,

                            4
            green frogs there.  There were so many frogs there that all the streets and yards were
            covered with them.  The streets and yards being covered with frogs lasted until the
                              5
                  6
            1970s.  The frogs started disappearing then because suddenly there were lots of large
            American bullfrogs in the area, and American bullfrogs eat small frogs.  At that time,
                                                                           7
            farmers were raising American bullfrogs to sell to restaurants for their frog legs.

            8  However, eating frog legs went out of fashion, so the farmers released their bullfrogs
                              9
                                                                                10
            into the wilderness.  The bullfrogs found their way to the Los Angeles river.  Then the

            bullfrogs found the small green frogs in Frogtown.  They ate them.  Then there were
            hardly any frogs left in Frogtown.



             1. Combine sentence 1 and 2. Change Frogtown in sentence 2 to even though that
              and delete the though at the end of sentence 2. Add a comma before even though
              to make this long sentence easier to read.

             3. In sentence 3, add it is called Frogtown because after but to clarify meaning.

             4. In sentence 4, add at times before the streets and yards for accuracy.

             5. In sentence 5, change The streets and yards being covered with frogs to This to
              better connect the sentences and avoid repetition.

             6. Add the adverb phrase when the frogs started to disappear from Frogtown to the
              end of the sentence 5 to draw attention to the next event in the narrative.

             7. Add the question Where did the American bullfrogs come from? after sentence 6 to
              better connect the ideas in the paragraph.

                                  further divided into two categories: explicit and implicit.   Explicit memory is used

                                  when trying to recall a specific fact or event.   Examples of explicit memory include

                               Becoming an Everyday Environmentalist

                1  People can take some steps to protect the environment.   One of the easiest steps
                                                                  2

            and lowers one’s electric bill.   One more step is to turn on a fan and raise the setting
                                      4
            on the air conditioner.   This will make the people in the room feel cooler.   In addition
                                                                              6

            9  Another way to save money is to get tap water instead of buying water in a bottle.
            10  Bottled water is more expensive than tap water, and it comes in plastic bottles, which

            contribute to pollution.   People can plant gardens.   Growing vegetables at home helps

            can help save the environment, and these first steps are both easy and rewarding.




             1. In sentence 1, the word some is vague. Change it to the more specific phrase
              several simple.
             2. In sentence 3, the introductory phrase Turning off the lights is repetitive. Change it
              to this step.

             3. In sentence 4, one more is informal. Replace it with another.

             4. In sentence 5, replace This with The fan to create a smooth transition between
              sentences 4 and 5.
             5. In sentence 9, the verb get is vague and informal. Change it to drink.

            Notes
            1.   A simple sentence has only one clause, which means one subject–verb combination. A simple sentence can have
              two subjects or two verbs, but there is only one subject–verb relationship.
            2. Use a comma between three or more items in a series. Do not use a comma between two items.
                Japan, China, and Cambodia import oil.
                Japan and China import oil.
            3.  The basic word order of simple sentences is one of the four below:
              a.  S + V + direct object (for action verbs with direct objects)
                  Many children do not eat celery very often.
              b.  S + V (+ prepositional phrase) (for nonaction verbs that do not take direct objects)
                  William Shakespeare died in 1616.
              c.  S + be + adjective/noun phrase
                  Vegetables are nutritious.
              d.  S + V + noun phrase
                  Curing the common cold is still a challenge for scientists.
            4.  Prepositional phrases can be added to basic sentence patterns. When a prepositional phrase is at the beginning of a
              sentence, use a comma.

                 A compound sentence has two or more independent clauses that are connected by a coordinating
                 conjunction. Three common coordinating conjunctions in academic writing are and, but, and so.

                 Coordinating Conjunctions

                 and      The moon is a satellite of the earth, and it circles around the sun.

                 but      The first manned landing on the moon was in 1969, but the first unmanned one was in 1959.

                 so       Gravity is weaker on the moon, so everything on the moon weighs less.
                 Notes
                 1. A comma is used before the coordinating conjunction in a compound sentence.
                       Both temperate and tropical rainforests have high amounts of rainfall, but the average temperature in tropical
                     rainforests is higher.
                 2.  Academic sentences do not usually begin with conjunctions.

            10.3   Using Simple Sentences

            Simple sentences are used in academic writing to focus the readers’ attention on one piece of
            information. They are used:

            1.  to state information                         The most recently discovered metal,

            10.4   Using Compound Sentences

            Compound sentences are used in academic writing to connect related ideas. The coordinating
            conjunction shows the relationship between ideas. Coordinating conjunctions are used:

            1.   to add information about a topic or compare   Kitchen fires are the most common cause of
               two topics (with and)                         house fires, and faulty heating systems are the
                                                             second most common cause.

            2.  to show contrasting information about a topic   Brazil has the largest population in South
               (with but)                                    America, but Ecuador has the greatest
                                                             population density.

            3.  to show a causal relationship (with the effect   In 2016, Mars’s orbit was closer to Earth’s orbit
               in the second clause after so (that))         than usual, so many people were able to observe
                                                             Mars without a telescope.
            Notes
            1.  The three most common conjunctions in academic writing are and, but, and so. The conjunctions or, nor, for and yet
              are not as common in academic writing.
            2.  Do not use a comma before so (that) when it introduces a purpose. With a purpose, so (that) means in order that.
                Scientists need to conduct research so (that) they can determine the effectiveness of a new medicine.
            3. Good academic writing generally includes a variety of simple and compound sentences in the same paragraph.

              are recommending that they eat more foods that are high in vitamins C, D, and

              E. These particular vitamins help to strengthen the immune system they can

              also help to make sneezing, coughing, and itchy eyes less serious. There are also

              medications that help reduce allergy symptoms. But these medications tend to
              make people feel drowsy. (3)

             2.      Almost all birds find mates they stay with them for life. This sounds very

              romantic birds probably do not stay with their mates because they are in love.
              Zoologists believe birds such as geese stay together because it is easier to survive.

              Instead of spending time fighting with other birds, they can spend that time taking

              care of their young. It is a very dangerous world for baby birds. So having two
              parents taking care of the babies means they are more likely to survive. (3)

              World Heritage site in 1983. Most archeologists believe that the Incas built Machu

              absolutely certain. It is on a flat area on the top of a 7,970-foot mountain it was very

              difficult to get to. When the Spanish came to colonize Peru in the sixteenth century,
              the Incas abandoned Machu Picchu. The Spanish destroyed many other beautiful sites

              they never found Machu Picchu Machu Picchu was left untouched. Machu Picchu

              remained untouched until 1911, when an American historian “discovered” it. (4)

             4.      Lighthouses keep ships from crashing into rocks they help to guide ships
              through dangerous waters or into harbors. They are usually in remote locations far

              away from cities where there are not many lights at night they are also near harbors

              to show ship captains how to get into the harbors. Traditionally, lighthouses have
              been very tall, narrow, circular towers with a revolving light on the top. In the past,

              people needed to live in the lighthouses to turn the lights on and to check that

              everything was working correctly. Now everything is automated it is not necessary

              for people to live in lighthouses anymore. (3)

            others, and the cultures that smile less often might think that people who smile often are

            Asia.  People smile there when they feel nervous or anxious.  Very few other cultures do

             1. Combine sentences 1 and 2 with the conjunction but. Delete the repeated phrase

             2. Start sentence 3 with In fact to show that this sentence emphasizes the point in
              sentences 1 and 2.

             3. Start sentence 4 with For example.

             4. Combine sentences 4 and 5 with the conjunction and to connect the ideas.

             5. Add a comma and in their opinion to the end of sentence 7 to emphasize that this

               On a separate sheet of paper, write a comparison paragraph (at least six sentences)
               about two things that interest you. Explain what the two things are, and show how
               they are similar or different. Use facts, details, or examples. Use at least one example
               of a compound sentence with but, and, or so and underline it; try to use two if
               possible.

               Here are some examples of how to begin.

                                     1  Thatching is a very old process for making roofs out of straw or grass.  Because

                                  roofs were replaced with slate, a material made from rock.  These days, however,

                                  thatched roofs have an increased risk of fire.  Despite these drawbacks, thatched roofs

            11.1  Parallelism with Coordinating Conjunctions

            Parallelism means that each item in a list has the same grammatical structure. Parallelism can occur
            in sets of words, phrases, and clauses. Use parallelism with items before and after coordinating
            conjunctions. Use it with:

            1. words                  The official languages of Switzerland are German, French, Italian, and
                                      Romansh. (nouns)

            Correlative conjunctions are used with two items that are equal in importance or weight. The
            structures before and after correlative conjunctions need to be parallel.

            1. both . . . and         Shoes with very high heels are both uncomfortable and unsafe.

           this paragraph. Write your revised paragraph on a separate sheet of paper. Be careful with capitalization

                                        Levels of Airline Service

                1  For long-distance flights, all airlines these days offer three levels of service.   They are
                                                                                   2
            Economy Class, Business Class, and First Class.   These levels differ in price and comfort.
                                                       3
            4  As most tourists know, Economy Class is the cheapest but also the least comfortable

            level of service.   It is also known as Coach.   Seats are narrow and legroom is tight.   On
                          5
                                                                                      7
                                                   6
            many airlines, passengers must pay extra to reserve a specific seat or check an extra bag.
                                                                    9
            8  One solution is to pay five times more and fly Business Class.   In Business Class, the
            seats are wider.   In Business Class, there is more legroom.   The food and service are
                                                                 11
                          10
            superior.   If these luxuries are not enough, travelers can choose to fly First Class.   They
                                                                                     13
                     12
            can enjoy private suites, gourmet food, showers, and even massages.   However, this

            level of service is expensive.   A ticket in First Class can cost twice as much as Business
                                     15
            Class and up to twenty times as much as Economy Class.




             1. In sentence 1, add the word nearly before all airlines for accuracy.
             2. Sentence 2 lists the three levels of service in sentence 1. Combine the sentences by replacing the
              period in sentence 1 with a colon. Delete They are from sentence 2.

             3. In sentence 3, add the word both after differ for emphasis.

             4. In sentence 4, add the adjective clause which is also known as Coach Class after Economy Class.
              Place commas before and after the adjective clause. Delete sentence 5.
             5. The word level is used in sentences 3 and 4. For variety, change it to class in sentence 4.

             6. Combine sentences 9 and 10 into one sentence. Delete In Business Class from sentence 10, and add
              the conjunction and.

             7. In sentence 12, add the word wealthy before travelers.
             8. Combine sentences 12 and 13 by adding the word where.

             9. Move However to the end of sentence 14.

             10. In sentence 15, add a ticket in before Business Class and before Economy Class for parallelism.

                                                             Headaches in Children

                                     1  A surprising number of children as young as four or five suffer from headaches

                                  regularly.   There are a variety of factors that could be causing these headaches
                                          2
                                                                  3
                                  from stress to too much screen time.   To have a better idea of the causes of a child’s
                                  headaches, parents could try to keep a journal of when headaches occur.   However,
                                                                                                  4
                                  before getting too concerned, pediatricians suggest that parents try to make some simple
                                          5
                                  changes.   For example, some children’s headaches are caused by not getting enough
                                               6
                                  sleep at night.   Children who are still taken naps during the day may sleep better
                                               7
                                  without them.   Headaches can also occur when young children are not fed at regular
                                                                            8
                                  intervals or are not gave enough water to drink.   Pediatricians usually suggest that
                                  parents try these changes before giving their children headache medication.

            3.  For passive modals, the base form of be is used and the modal form does not change.
            4.  Progressive passives are rarely used in academic writing.
            5.  See Appendix 4, Irregular Verbs, page 220, for irregular past participles.

            12.2   Using Passive Voice

            The passive voice is commonly used in writing when the doer of the action (or agent) is not known or
            not important. It is used:

            1.  to focus attention on the action of the      YouTube was founded in 2005.

            2.  Only transitive verbs (verbs that take a direct object) can be made passive. Intransitive verbs (verbs that do not take
              direct objects, such as work, exist, or happen) cannot be made passive.
                A full moon always rises just as the sun is setting. (The verbs are intransitive, so no passive form is possible.)

                 7. When parents get divorced, often children are too young to be told the real reasons for the divorce.

                 8. To learn about the density of ice, ice cubes are dropped into a glass of cooking oil so that students
                   can observe what happens to the ice as it melts.



                  ACTIVITY 3

               Label the underlined verbs in these active sentences T (transitive) or I (intransitive). Then rewrite the
               sentences with transitive verbs as passive sentences. Add by phrases only when necessary.

           Read the classification paragraph. Then follow the directions in the 10 steps to edit the information and
           composition of this paragraph. Write your revised paragraph on a separate sheet of paper. Be careful with
           capitalization and punctuation. Check your answers with the class.




              CLASSIFICATION PARAGRAPH


                                  Elements of an Effective Apology

                1  Apologizing can be a difficult thing to do.   According to recent research,
                                                      2
            an effective apology needs to contain various elements.   However, there are
                                                              3
            two elements that people consider more important than all the others.   For an apology
                                                                           4
            to be effective, it should include an admission of responsibility.   Some people
                                                                    5
            apologize with an excuse for their action, saying for example, “I’m sorry, but I was tired,”

            or “I’m sorry, but I didn’t realize you would be bothered by . . .”   In these apologies,
                                                                     6
            there is no blame or responsibility.   What is heard is only an excuse.   This type of
                                                                         8
                                           7
            apology can make the offended person even more upset or angry.   Another element
                                                                       9
            that should be included in an effective apology is an offer to fix the situation.   Offering
                                                                                 10
            to fix the situation shows that the apologizer has thought a lot about the offensive

            behavior.   It also shows that the apologizer has thought a lot about the offended
                     11
            person, too.   One common element of an apology that is not very helpful is to ask
                       12
            for forgiveness, so that part can be omitted.



             1. Add effectively to the end of sentence 1 to better define the paragraph topic.

             2. Combine sentences 2 and 3. Change the period between element and However to a semi-colon.

             3. In sentence 3, people (the agent) is not that important. Change people consider to are considered.


             4. Start sentence 4 with First and a comma to emphasize that this is the first element.

             5. In sentence 6, change there is no blame or responsibility to the passive form no blame or
              responsibility is communicated.

             6. In sentence 7, add or justification after excuse.

             7. Start sentence 9 with Second and a comma to emphasize that this is the second element.

                 ACTIVITY 11   Original Writing


               On a separate sheet of paper, write a classification paragraph (at least six sentences) about a topic that
               interests you. Explain what it is and give facts, details, and/or examples. Use at least one example of the
               passive voice and underline it; try to use two if possible.

               Here are some examples of how to begin.
                 •  Most people have several different kinds of friends.
                 •  An interesting presentation needs to include certain elements.
                 •  Most people spend their vacation in one of three ways.

                                     1  In the process of trying to save endangered species, many wildlife organizations

                                  turn to governments, businesses, and local communities for help.   The first, and perhaps
                                                                                            2
                                  most important, step in saving plants and animals is to have as wide-reaching an impact
                                  as possible.   Because governments—national, regional, and local—can help the effort by

                                  passing laws for protect the wildlife and their habitats, organizations turn to them first.

                                  4  Another step organizations can take is to contact businesses, both large and small.
                                  5  For example, businesses can help endangered species by landscaping with native plants

                                  in their business parks.   Finally, a third step organizations can take is to work within

                                  their local communities.   By sponsoring fairs and educational events, local communities

                                  help increase awareness of the need to protect native species.   It is important to educate
                                  people about the wildlife in their community and to offer ways to protect the animals’

              responsible for.






            13.6   Using Infinitives

           steps to edit the information and composition of this paragraph. Write your revised
           paragraph on a separate sheet of paper. Be careful with capitalization and punctuation.
           Check your answers with the class.




               PROCESS PARAGRAPH


                                           Finding More Time
                1  Many people try to handle both personal and professional responsibilities, which

             is often an overwhelming task.  However, there are some simple steps people can take
                                        2
             to put more time into their day.  The first step is to set realistic goals.  It is not realistic
                                         3
                                                                          4
             to have 15 items on a daily to-do list.  Instead, list the top three or four work items that
                                              5
             need to be finished before the day is over.  Check off each item as it is accomplished.
                                                  6
             7  The second step is scheduling all of one’s personal activities, including exercise.  This
                                                                                    8
             means writing down what time one will go to the gym, take a walk, or practice yoga.

             9  Doing this ensures some alone time will be available every day.  Finally, the last step is
                                                                     10
             to learn to say “no” to people who waste one’s time.  For example, instead of standing
                                                           11
             in the parking lot talking to a co-worker about the boss for 20 minutes, leave the office

             and head directly for home.  There is no easy solution to finding all the time one wants
                                     12
             or needs, but if one takes these steps, it will lead one in the right direction.



             1. In sentence 1, change the subject Many people try to Trying.

             2. Because sentence 1 now begins with a gerund, omit which and the comma. The
              verb is now agrees with the subject Trying.

             3. In sentence 2, replace some with the more specific term three.

             4. Sentence 4 gives an example for sentence 3. Begin sentence 4 with For example.
             5. In sentence 7, change the verb is to requires.

             6. In sentence 9, change alone to the more academic term private.

             7. In sentence 10, replace to learn to say “no” to with the more formal infinitive to
              avoid.

                                   Recognizing the Sleep-Deprived

                1  People who do not get enough sleep are said to be sleep-deprived.   It is easy
                                                                             2
            to identify people who are sleep-deprived by the way they look and the way they

            behave.   First of all, people who are sleep-deprived always look tired.   For example,
                    3
                                                                           4
            their eyes are usually red or bloodshot, and they often have dark circles under their
            eyes.   Moreover, instead of the corners of their mouths turning up, the corners tend to
                 5
            droop, which makes them look sad.   People who are sleep-deprived are also easy to
                                            6
            recognize by the impatient way they behave.   While waiting in line, they may tap their
                                                    7
            feet and mutter, “Come on. I don’t have all day.”   People who honk their car horns
                                                       8
            at the drivers in front of them as soon as the traffic light turns green are likely
            sleep-deprived.   In meetings, these people tap their pencils on the table and sigh
                           9
            heavily every few minutes.   Their struggle to stay awake is obvious.   They yawn
                                    10
                                                                         11
            in the middle of important discussions.   They put their heads down on their desks
                                                12
            when they think no one is looking.   They are never without a cup of coffee in one
                                            13
            hand and a snack in the other.   One keeps them awake, and one gives them energy.
                                        14
            15  These characteristics of people with chronic sleep deficiencies all point to one thing:
            people do not look or act their best when they do not get enough sleep.




             1. In sentence 3, replace people who are sleep-deprived with they to avoid repetition.

             2. In sentence 6, change are sleep-deprived again to lack sleep for variety.

             3. In sentence 6, the impatient way they behave is awkward. Change it to

             4. In sentence 8, replace sleep-deprived with suffering from insufficient sleep
              for variety.

           Read the comparison paragraph about foreign language learning. Then follow the
           directions in the 10 steps to edit the information and composition of this paragraph.
           Write your revised paragraph on a separate sheet of paper. Be careful with capitalization
           and punctuation. Check your answers with the class.




              COMPARISON PARAGRAPH

                           How Learning a Foreign Language Has Changed

                1  Learning a foreign language today is different from learning one 25 years ago.

                                           3
            2  One difference is in the methods.  Today, students practice all four skills: listening,
            speaking, reading, and writing.  They work with partners to share and compare
                                        4
                                                        5
            answers, and they have small group discussions.  In the past, students spent much of
            their class time studying grammar.  They worked alone and waited for their instructor
                                            6
            to give them the answers.  Their speaking practice focused on repeating grammar drills
                                    7
                                       8
            or memorized conversations.  Another difference in learning a foreign language is
                           9
            in the materials.  Classroom materials include books with reading, writing, speaking,
                                 10
            and listening activities.  Technology allows students to watch and listen to videos
                                 11
            and then discuss them.  Twenty-five years ago, classroom materials were grammar
            books filled with drills and no reading or writing activities.  Learning a foreign
                                                                 12
            language today is much more interactive and engaging for the student.



             1. In sentence 1, replace is different with the active verb differs.

             2. In sentence 2, add the adjective noticeable to emphasize the difference.

             3. In sentence 4, begin the sentence with the transition In addition and a comma.
             4. In sentence 4, add the adverb collaboratively after the verb work.

             5. In sentence 5, add the transition however and a comma before the subject to
              emphasize the contrast between methods.

             6. Begin sentence 9 with For example and a comma.

             7. Begin sentence 10 with Today and a comma.

           Being a good writer involves many skills, such as being able to write with correct
           grammar, vary your vocabulary, and state ideas concisely. A good writer also learns to
           create longer, more detailed sentences from simple ideas. Study the short sentences
           below.
              Jim Thorpe won two medals.
              The medals were Olympic medals.
              They were gold medals.
              He won them in 1912.
              He was not allowed to keep the medals.

           Notice that every sentence has an important piece of information. A good writer would
           not write all these sentences separately. Instead, the most important information from
           each sentence can be used to create one longer, coherent sentence.

           Read the sentences again; this time, the important information has been circled.

              Jim Thorpe won two medals.

              The medals were Olympic medals.

              They were gold medals.

              He won them in 1912.

              He was not allowed to keep the medals.

           Here are some strategies for taking the circled information and creating a new sentence.
            1. Create time phrases to introduce or end a sentence: in 1912
            2. Find the key nouns: Jim Thorpe, medals
            3. Find key adjectives: two, Olympic, gold
            4. Create noun phrases: two + Olympic + gold + medals
            5. Connect main ideas with conjunctions: won medals + but not allowed to keep them

           Now read this improved, longer sentence:

            In 1912, Jim Thorpe won two Olympic gold medals, but he was not allowed to keep them.

           Here are some additional strategies for building better sentences.
            1.  Use coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, nor, yet, for, so) to connect related ideas
               equally.
            2.  Use subordinating conjunctions, such as after, while, since, and because to connect
               related ideas when one idea is more important than the other.
            3.  Use clauses with relative pronouns, such as who, which, that, and whose to
               describe or define a noun or noun phrase.
            4. Use pronouns to refer to previously mentioned information.

                Commas

                 Rule                                             Example

                 A comma separates the items in a list of three or   She speaks French, English, and Chinese.

                 Use a comma when the information in the clause

               A paragraph is a group of sentences about one topic or one idea. It may have a title at the top. The first
               sentence of the paragraph is indented. The topic sentence is often near the beginning and introduces the
               main idea. The sentences in the body of the paragraph are connected to the topic sentence. They support
               and build on the main idea with facts, details, and reasons. The concluding sentence usually states the
               main point again or summarizes the main idea of the paragraph.


                       The Effect of Cell phones on Drivers                    Title

                      A recent study by Donald Redelmeir and Robert            Indented first line
                 Tibshirani of the University of Toronto showed that           Topic sentence

                 cell phones pose a risk to drivers. In fact, people who

                 talk on the phone while driving are four times more
                 likely to have an automobile accident than those

                 who do not use the phone while driving. The Toronto

                 researchers studied 699 drivers who had been in
                 an automobile accident while they were using their

                 cell phones. The researchers concluded that the main

                 one hand for the telephone and had one hand on

                 the steering wheel. Rather the cause of the accidents
                 was usually that the drivers became distracted, angry,

                 or upset by the phone call. The drivers then lost

                 concentration and were more likely to be in a car
                 accident. The study showed why using cell phones

                 while driving leads to increased accidents.

               academic word families that regularly appear in academic texts. The AWL was compiled by researcher
               Averil Coxhead based on her analysis of a 3.5-million-word corpus of academic texts and is reprinted with
               her permission.
